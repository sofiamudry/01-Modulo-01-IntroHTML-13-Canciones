    <h1>Bad Blood</h1>
    <span>Taylor Swift</span><span>1989</span>Publicado en 2014
    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>Cause baby now we got bad blood
        You know it used to be mad love
        So take a look at what you've done
        'Cause baby now we got bad blood</p>
    <p>Hey! I can't take it back, look where I'm at
        We was OG like D.O.C., remember that?
        My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
        Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
        I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
        These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
        Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
        No, I don't fear no more
        Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more</p>
    <p>Oh, it's so sad to
        Think about the good times
        You and I</p>
    <p>Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
        You know it used to be mad love
        So take a look what you've done
        'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
        Now we've got problems
        And I don't think we can solve 'em
        You made a really deep cut
        And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!</p>
    <p>Remember when you tried to write me off?
        Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
        Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
        Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
        It was my season for battle wounds
        Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
        Stabbed in the back, brimstone, fire jumping through
        Still, all my life, I got money and power
        And you gotta live with the bad blood now</p>
    <p>Oh, it's so sad to
        Think about the good times
        You and I</p>
    <p>Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
        You know it used to be mad love
        So take a look what you've done
        'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
        Now we've got problems
        And I don't think we can solve 'em
        You made a really deep cut
        And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!</p>
    <p>Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
        You say sorry just for show
        If you live like that, you live with ghosts
        (You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go)
        Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
        You say sorry just for show
        If you live like that, you live with ghosts
        If you love like that, blood runs cold</p>
    <p>Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
        You know it used to be mad love
        So take a look what you've done
        'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
        Now we've got problems
        And I don't think we can solve 'em
        You made a really deep cut
        And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!</p>
    <p>Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
        You know it used to be mad love
        So take a look what you've done
        'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
        Now we've got problems
        And I don't think we can solve 'em
        You made a really deep cut
        And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
