    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>He said, "Let's get out of this town
        Drive out of the city away from the crowds"
        I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
        Nothin' lasts forever
        But this is gonna take me down
        He's so tall and handsome as hell
        He's so bad but he does it so well
        I can see the end as it begins
        My one condition is</p>
    <p>Say you'll remember me
        Standin' in a nice dress
        Starin' at the sunset, babe
        Red lips and rosy cheeks
        Say you'll see me again
        Even if it's just in your
        Wildest dreams, ah, ha
        Wildest dreams, ah, ha
        </p>
    <p>I said, "No one has to know what we do"
        His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
        And his voice is a familiar sound
        Nothin' lasts forever
        But this is gettin' good now
        He's so tall and handsome as hell
        He's so bad but he does it so well
        And when we've had our very last kiss
        But my last request is</p>
    <p>Say you'll remember me
        Standin' in a nice dress
        Starin' at the sunset babe
        Red lips and rosy cheeks
        Say you'll see me again
        Even if it's just in your
        Wildest dreams, ah, ha (ha, ha)
        Wildest dreams, ah, ha</p>
    <p>You'll see me in hindsight
        Tangled up with you all night
        Burnin' it down
        Someday, when you leave me
        I bet these memories
        Follow you around
        You'll see me in hindsight
        Tangled up with you all night
        Burnin' (burnin'), it (it), down (down)
        Someday, when you leave me
        I bet these memories
        Follow (follow), you (you), around
        (Follow you around)</p>
    <p>Say you'll remember me
        Standing in a nice dress
        Starin' at the sunset, babe
        Red lips and rosy cheeks
        Say you'll see me again
        Even if it's just pretend</p>
    <p>Say you'll remember me
        Standin' in a nice dress
        Starin' at the sunset babe
        Red lips and rosy cheeks
        Say you'll see me again
        Even if it's just in your (just pretend)
        Wildest dreams, ah, ha (ah)
        In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
        Even if it's just in your
        Wildest dreams, ah, ha (ah)
        In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
        </p>
